"""Why each shared session produced no environment, derived rather than typed.

Arena's batch acceptance requires 100% of shared traces dispositioned:
"converted -> env IDs, or excluded -> reason". `deliverable.trace_accounting`
derives the converted side from the delivered tree, which leaves the exclusions.

Typing those by hand is how a batch report drifts from what the funnel actually
did, so every reason here is recomputed from the selection artifacts the funnel
already wrote. The exclusions carry a reason *code* as well as prose because the
distinction the codes draw is the one a reader of this report most needs:

    kill_filter                 we looked and the session cannot support a task
    requires_execution / none   we looked and there is no checkable truth source
    qualified_not_built         it qualified; we ran out of authoring budget
    below_classification_depth  we never looked

Only the first two are judgements about Arena's corpus. The last two are
statements about ours, and collapsing them into "excluded" would report our
capacity as a property of their traces.
