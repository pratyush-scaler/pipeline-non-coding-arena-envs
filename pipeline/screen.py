"""Phase 4 -- the calibration screen: five episodes on each of two models.

The pipeline is select -> author -> grade -> calibrate, and it stops there.
This module is the calibrate phase. It runs once the WHOLE requested batch has
been authored and graded -- never per task, and never inside the design loop --
and it runs again, by hand, after every hardening round. What it produces is a
table: pass@1, pass@4 and mean reward per task per model, the failure
attribution behind every zero, and a hardening outlook per task.

    screen                 5 episodes x 2 models   every new batch; every hardening round
    calibration of record  10 episodes x 2 models  `arena qualify`, only once shippable

It replaced two things. The one-episode presolve, which ran after every draft
on one model and sent "too easy" back into the design loop; and the in-build
difficulty pilot. Neither survives: difficulty is authored into the first draft
(the designer is told to build the traps in), and it is MEASURED here, after the
batch exists. Nothing in this module feeds back into authoring -- scores and
solver answers are never repair feedback (`policy.REPAIR_FEEDBACK_EXCLUDES`).

The measurement is the calibration of record's, narrower: the same native
Terminus-2 backend, the same two spec models, `high` effort, no turn or time
limits, the same evidence verification and the same void-only top-up
(`release._calibrate_model`). A void leaves every denominator. A scored episode
is never re-run: a screen retained for this exact task version is reused, and a
new one is launched only for a model the task version has not been screened on.

A screen is a MEASUREMENT, never a difficulty gate. pass@1 < 0.5 on both
models is the strict target (`policy.CALIBRATION_TARGET_PASS_AT_1`): reported
for every task, aimed at by hardening, and blocking nothing. The one thing a
screen decides is whether the ten-episode calibration of record may be spent,
and that only on VALIDITY -- enough valid episodes, every failure attributable,
no unresolved reward hacking (`shippable_problems`, read by `release._qualify`).
