"""File a working tree into the shape Arena receives.

Two trees, deliberately, because they answer different questions:

    working tree    envs-fresh/rich/a-001-wordpress-site-audit
                    filed by SOURCE CATEGORY, which is known before authoring
                    starts and says which trace to attempt first.

    delivery tree   F2-scenario/a_f2_wordpress-site-audit
                    filed by MEASURED FAITHFULNESS, which is only knowable
                    after the build, from what actually survived into the task.

The build cannot create the delivery folder directly: it has to name the
directory before it has a ledger to measure, and a bundle filed as `F3-replay/`
that then measures F2 would be a directory lying about its contents. So filing
is a separate step that runs once the evidence exists.

It also does the work that only makes sense with the whole batch in view:
disambiguating names that collide. `a-002-brand-consulting` and
`a-003-brand-consulting` both reduce to `a_f2_brand-consulting`, and two tasks
cannot share a Harbor package name.

Nothing here decides whether a task is good. `release.py` does that, and a task
that is not accepted is filed with its blockers rather than quietly dropped --
an empty category is a finding, not something to hide.
